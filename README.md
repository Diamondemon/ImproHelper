# ImproHelper

ImproHelper is an app made to help Improvisation judges to prepare and organise their improvisations list for the matches they will judge.

It provides multiple features such as:
- a generator of improvisation topics
- a history of all the past created improvisations
- a view showing all of the past and future matches registered in the app
- a display of the different teams' scores and a view dedicated to the current match with a built-in chronometer and the list of all the prepared improvisation topics for the match 

The "Current match" view also provides a random word generator for specific kinds of improvisation categories.
